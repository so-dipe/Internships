# Internships

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks related to some internships I did..

## Notebooks
- `Hamoye Test.ipynb`: This notebook just show work I did on reading data with pandas.
- `Regression at Hamoye.ipynb`: This notebook includes work on solving a supervised learning problem with Regression and Regularization (Ridge and Lasso).
- `TSA.ipynb`: Here, I did a presentation on Time Series Analysis for my collegues. I had to explain all I did so it's a little technical but contains emojis.
- `TSA 2.ipynb`: Just the same as `TSA.ipynb` but with little changes. Corrections my teammates wanted. I just kept the original because I wanted to.
- `TSA 3.ipynb`: Just a few correction again.
- `Fellowship.ai\IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`: This notebook was my application to an internship. I did sentiment analysis on movies reviews. It also contains a lot of explaniation.
