review,imdb rating
"This was such a fun movie to watch. It was long, but didn't feel longer than a regular movie. There was a lot of action, but also great character exposition. I don't want to give anything away, but I loved the novel perspective on leadership this one evolved to. Also the contrast between how different Black Panthers inhabit that role, and the implications of that.

I loved the new world discovered, with its own mythology, and the way those two worlds can come together, for good or ill. I can't wait to see where the story goes next.

Beautiful scenes and fun story with great characters. And the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, both his character and the actor, were deeply moving and tastefully done. Great soundtrack too. Just all around a great way to spend an afternoon with the family.",10/10
"I am conflicted with this film and with Marvel.

Let's review the good first. There is a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and obviously to the actor who played him. The emotions shown feel real and manage to move. The performances are good in this regard. Angela Bassett stands out above the rest.

I'm not one to oppose the replacement of Atlantis by Talokan, as this gives another excellent excuse to show some content that derives from universal culture in gigantic products like the MCU movies. Namor is an excellent addition to the ranks of Marvel superheroes immediately showing how powerful he is and what he is capable of.

The action sequences are entertaining, as Marvel has already accustomed us.

The wardrobe is also something to value in this film. There is a great effort and meaning behind each of the suits, which successfully try to mix the different cultures with the new times full of technology. This makes an excellent contribution to character design.

Now what I didn't like about the movie. The entire story feels too light and if you think about it, pretty ridiculous. Namor's motivations don't match his plans or his actions throughout the film. Marvel Studios again falls flat when writing and developing their villains. It all feels like a mere excuse for the characters to clash. There is nothing really of weight in the story, except for the death of T'Challa, which is also not well used, abusing the drama whenever they can.

I liked Riri Williams' introduction, but not Ironheart's introduction. The story devoured her as a secondary character and was relegated to the background when in fact the beginning of the film gives her much more importance.

The pacing of the movie is inconsistent. It's pretty monotonous until the action scenes, which are good, but short. Sometimes, there is too much information happening too fast without giving the opportunity to fully appreciate each sequence and each character involved.

Finally, the effects are good, as expected, but something is wrong with the composition of the cities. Both Wakanda and Talokan have a contrast and color problem that prevents them from being fully appreciated.

The final battle scenario also seems pretty bad to me.

Overall, the movie is entertaining if you just want to have fun with fights and visuals, but I think it's about time Marvel got serious about their movies and realized that adults are also consuming superhero movies.",6/10
"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?

I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.

So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.

You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.

And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",4/10
"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.

Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.",6/10
"I just got out of The Batman

This movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.

This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.

Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.

On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!

I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.",8/10
"Matt Reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk. (Thank goodness The Batman is at least the latter instead of the former). If the director wasn't trying sooooo hard to make the film 'dark' maybe he could have created a new category of just overrated.

Firstly, David Fincher himself is bad enough, but David Fincher imitations are even worse. This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while indulging the trope of the classical music-loving psychopath). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference. And it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the Riddler's petty mind games- - if I was there I would promptly tell him to p*ss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere, even if there was a bomb strapped to my neck.

Secondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.

Thirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. (Compare any Riddler murder to the one in 'Dial M for Murder', which is one of the more mediocre Hitchcocks). Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.

Ugh. If any good this would have become DC's highest grossing film ever. As it is, people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop.",3/10
"I watch and re-watch a lot of movies per year as a hobby (no money involved), and today I have 9988 reviews in IMDb. Last month, I received an email from IMDb listing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" as one of the Top-10 movies of 2022. In IMDb, it is informed that this flick is nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards, 240 wins and 351 nominations. I can only understand that this is a heard behavior to the promotion of studio, using ""professional critics"" and press to promote such a garbage. I cannot envision a normal being, without financial interest or being manipulated by critics, to enjoy this crap. It seems to be a bad trip of the writers turned into a movie by insane productors. In the end, this film is 2h 19 min of complete waste of time. My vote is one (awful).",1/10
"Visual Orgy of Visual Metaphors That Get Old Well Before Film Ends. So disappointing, and the film doesn't live up to the hype. First half has some engaging moments, where it could have wrapped up without ""explaining"" what we already knew. I don't need a primer to explain the content and themes of a film thank you very much.

Could of been so much better, but film fails to rely upon the intricate visuals so painstakingly laid out, deciding we needed explanation of the filmmakers' intent instead. Such a hedge essentially ruined this film - it is awkward and runs about 45 minutes too long. Nice effort visually - my rating id higher than I feel it should be, but the visuals were often witty, so...5.

Overall, I had to force myself to see entire film, and it was painful. I feel cheated out of ""what could have been."" Perhaps one Director would have made a difference. Don't know. Won't ever know. It's a self-indulgent mess. ",5/10
"Sticking to the lower budget roots that got him a start in a big way thanks to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, Guy Ritchie has followed up his minor but well-received The Gentleman with Wrath of Man, a crime thriller that sees the divisive but entertaining director get his favorite lad Jason Statham back on leading man duties.

The last time these two long term friends teamed up was for the near forgotten about Revolver, a film that is actually a lot better than you may remember it being, and Wrath of Man is far more straight forward than that affair, with Ritchie remaking European film Cash Truck to deliver a hard-boiled and gritty 90's like action/thriller that gives Statham some of his best material in years.

It may surprise many that this reforming of Ritchie and Statham see's the usually flamboyant director dial things back a notch or two with his hyperkinetic visuals and edits few and far between here and his cockney tinged humor reigned right in as we instead get a mostly humorous free affair following Statham's mysterious H in a new job for a cash truck company that has recently been hit by a deadly heist and seems destined to be targeted once more by a group of elite robbers looking to make a quick buck.

With some bleak but atmospheric cinematography from Alan Stewart, some moody and effective scoring from composer Christopher Benstead and some grizzled performances from co-stars Holt McCallany, Jeffrey Donovan, Scott Eastwood and for what feels like the first appearance in eons from Josh Hartnett, Wrath of Man is a solid all round package that benefits from Ritchie's experience hands as he delivers a non-linear examination of what lead H down this new employment path and who exactly is behind a string of well-oiled robberies taking place across Los Angeles.

There's certainly nothing new or unique about Wrath of Man's central plot or the moments that litter its runtime, in many ways this the definition of a vengeance/crime thriller rulebook in action but there's a sheen and professionalism on display throughout the film and with Statham having an absolute blast (figuratively and at times literally) being back with one of his longest serving collaborators and with some genuinely great set-pieces that ramp up to a pulse-pounding finale, Wrath of Man may not be top-shelf Ritchie, but its top-class crime thriller fare that will please all genre diehards.

Final Say -

Refrained Ritchie with just enough pizazz and flair to make you remember whose behind the camera, Wrath of Man is a throwback crime thriller with a killer lead character and some great set-ups, making this a consistently fun and impressively filmed watch without ever doing anything of a true noteworthy nature.",7/10
"Jason Statham and Guy Ritchie ... some might call them a dream team. And while Jason has the looks and drive to feel like an action ""hero"" of the past - he also has quite the talent to be above that cliche. We know him and even at the beginning of this, when no one of the other characters seem to know what they are dealing with - the audience knows there is more to the man, than we are shown.

Having said that, this apparently is a remake of a movie, that as you can tell, I have not seen yet. The original allegedly has more humor and story - which may be true -- I just know that the humor and fun is really wedged and almost entirely put into the first fourth of the movie ... before the action starts to kick in ... quite literally. Although it is more gun play overall.

An interesting story even if it seem to have gigantic holes ... but we take them with a spoon full of sugar ... and just let the movie works its magic. Relentless and focused on one thing ... and one thing alone ... the drive and motivation become clear ... and you may even root for him ... despite certain things - like a psych evaluation being necessary to name just one! Since the action is more than rock solid, all is good. And Scott Eastwood ... it's one thing to follow in your fathers footsteps (Clint, but you knew that hopefully), but a different thing to not just have the looks, but the charisma, acting ability and the overall screen presence to warrant that ... he is a bit underused in this, but even so fantastic nonetheless.",9/10
